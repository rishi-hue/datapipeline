# Building a Data Pipeline on AWS
 
In this project I proceeded to process, store & analyze data with ease from the same location using AWS Data Pipeline.
We use Amazon DynamoDB and made some fake data to populate it.
I configured data pipeline from dynamo db to s3 bucket. 
I then Launch EMR cluster. 
I read from DynamoDb and wrote to s3 bucket.
